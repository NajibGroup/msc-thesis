First, I would like to thank Dr. István Ráth and Zoltán Ujhelyi for providing the scientific foundations for my research and insight into software model verification.

I would like to thank my supervisors Ádám Lippai, Dávid Honfi, and Gábor Szárnyas for their friendly advice and enthusiasm. Also, I wish to express my gratitude to all my colleagues at Tresorit and the Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group who provided numerous valuable observations and suggestions. Especially Soma Lucz and Tamás Hegedűs for their input, energy and time.

Last but not least, I am deeply grateful to my family and friends for their continuous support.
